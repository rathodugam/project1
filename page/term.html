                that you provide to us is subject to the Privacy Policy. You are responsible for keeping your registration information up to date.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Subscription Terms</h2>
            <p>As a subscribed Scoutred member, each month you will have access to land use and property data. The subscription terms are as described in the subscription and checkout pages of the Website. See our subscription page for a description of the
                current subscriptions and prices. Note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a paid subscription are deemed part of this Agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Automatic Renewal; Subscription Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>As a subscribed Scoutred member, you acknowledge and consent to being charged a recurring payment and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to the cancellation of your membership. Your subscription will be automatically
                renewed for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription period originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate.</p>
            <p>You may cancel your ongoing membership by emailing your request to cancel to hello@scoutred.com. The day of the month that you start your ongoing membership is your anniversary date. Each subscription automatically renews on the anniversary
                date of the month following the end of the previous subscription period. You must notify us by emailing your request to cancel to hello@scoutred.com prior to the anniversary date of the month following the end of the previous subscription
                period to cancel your subscription. IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL PRIOR TO THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE MONTH FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR RENEWING THE SUBSCRIPTION. All cancellation requests received

                period will be given.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Billing and Payments</h2>
            <p>All information that you provide to Scoutred, including your credit card information, is subject to the Privacy Policy. If you have a subscription, your credit card will automatically be charged by a third party payment service each month
                for your ongoing subscription. For all other purchases, your credit card will be charged by a third party payment service who will transfer and deliver the funds to us at the time of purchase. For your convenience and continuous subscription
                benefits as a member, if your payment method reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your credit card information or cancel your membership, you authorize us to continue billing that credit card on file including extending the
                expiration date until we are notified by you or the credit card company that the account is no longer valid. We encourage you to constantly update your payment method information or cancel your membership should you wish to discontinue
                your subscription. We are not responsible for any fees or charges your issuing bank or credit card provider may charge you. If your payment to us is returned for any reason, you authorize us to continue billing your credit card on file
                and seek payment by another method until payment is received.</p>
            <p>We use a third party payment service in lieu of directly processing your credit card information. By submitting your credit card information, you grant Scoutred the right to store and process your information with the third party payment service,
                which it may change from time to time, and you agree that Scoutred will not be responsible for any failures of the third party payment service to adequately protect such information. All financial matters regarding your information are
                subject to the conditions of the third party payment service provider's terms of service. You acknowledge that we may change the third party payment service and move your information to other service providers that encrypt your information
                using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or other comparable security technology.</p>
